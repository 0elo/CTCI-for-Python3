# Cracking the Coding Interview for Python 3

A little interview prep never hurt anyone. This repo will solve questions from the 6th edition. Questions will be answered by chapter using Python 3.6 via Jupyter Notebook. Beyond just providing solutions, I will be diving in depth by exploring multiple implementations and testing each to ensure efficiency. Chapters 12: Java, 13: C++, and 14: Databases will understandably be excluded.
