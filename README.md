# Cracking the Coding Interview for Python 3

A little interview prep never hurt anyone. Questions will be answered by chapter using Python 3.6 via Jupyter Notebook. Beyond just providing solutions, I will be diving in depth by exploring multiple implementations and testing each to ensure efficiency. Chapters 12: Java, 13: C++, and 14: Databases will understandably be excluded.

Feel free to add to the chaos, whether it be alternate solutions, tests, or issues with my code. Any little bit helps! If providing alternate solutions, please only do so for problems that have already been solved (I want to tackle them first!).
